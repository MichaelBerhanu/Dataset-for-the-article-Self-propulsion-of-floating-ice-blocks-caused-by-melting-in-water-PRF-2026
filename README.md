The files Data'X'.txt give for the data set X, the bath temperature Tb, the diagonal length of the ice block L, the inclination of the diagonal theta, the bath salinity and the terminal propulsion velocity Ub.
See Appendix A of the article for the specifications of each data set.

The file DataMeltingVelocityFreshwater.txt gives the bath temperature Tb, the static ice block inclination and the measured melting velocity.
